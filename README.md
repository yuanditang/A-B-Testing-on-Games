# A/B Testing on Games

## Project Overview
This project involves conducting A/B testing on a gaming dataset to analyze and compare different versions of a game or feature to determine which performs better. The notebook applies statistical methods to help developers and data scientists make informed decisions based on user behavior.

## Files
- **A_B_Testing_on_Games.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the analysis for A/B testing. It includes data preprocessing, hypothesis testing, and visualizations to compare two variants (A and B) based on the results of user interactions with the game.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you need to install the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scipy
  - statsmodels

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy statsmodels
```

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
4. Open the **A_B_Testing_on_Games.ipynb** file.
5. Run the notebook cells sequentially to perform the analysis.

## Methodology
This notebook follows a structured approach to A/B testing:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize the distributions of user metrics, such as game engagement, playtime, or revenue.
3. **Hypothesis Formulation**: Define the null and alternative hypotheses for comparing the A and B groups.
4. **Statistical Testing**: Apply statistical tests (e.g., t-tests or chi-square tests) to determine if there are significant differences between the groups.
5. **Results Interpretation**: Analyze the results to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the changes introduced in version B compared to version A.

## Output
The notebook outputs visualizations and statistical results that provide insights into whether the game changes tested in version B are statistically significant compared to version A. It helps game developers understand whether implementing the tested change will likely lead to better user engagement or other key metrics.
